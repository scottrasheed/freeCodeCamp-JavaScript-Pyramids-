# JavaScript Pyramid Patterns

This project contains **15 different pyramid pattern scripts** written in JavaScript.  
They are based on the freeCodeCamp JavaScript pyramid exercises, and expanded with creative variations to showcase additional ways of using loops, conditionals, strings, and arrays.

All scripts print their respective patterns to the console.
